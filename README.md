# Unity Game Development Assignment

In this assignment, you have to develop a simple ping-pong game in Unity (C#).  
_Wireframes are provided at bottom for reference._

## TASK OVERVIEW

The game should have following features:

- **Main Menu**:
  - _Title_ with name of the game
  - _Play_ button
- **Game Screen**
  - _Paddle_: a paddle that can be moved vertically using touch or arrow keys
  - _Ball_: the ball that bounces back when hit by the paddle or walls
  - _Closed-Walls_: the walls prevent ball or paddle from going off-screen
  - _Score_: Each time ball hits the paddle, score number increases
- **Win/Lose Message**
  - When a player wins or loses, a screen with the message _‘You Win’_ or _‘You Lose’_ and the _scores_ will be shown.
  - This screen will have a button to _Retry_ which will start the game again
  - And a button to _Exit_ to Main Menu

## Gameplay:

- Move paddle up or down using touch or arrow keys to hit the ball
- Player loses if ball gets behind the paddle (out of screen from the left wall)
- Player wins when ball hits the paddle _10_ times
